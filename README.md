# Raytrace Final Project
======

### SMD Reader
------
* So far it doesn't keep track of bones, it will only read root bones.
* It doesn't care about materials. For this project we're only concerned about geometry.
* Written in Dev-C++, easily portable to linux.
* Accessing a value is done like this: triangle->v[0]->u;
